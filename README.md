# Tax Inconsistencies

This repository includes files with the code and verifications discussed in Limiting Inconsistencies in Legal Languages. Specifically, here you can find:

- [code with the formalization](https://github.com/slawsk/tax-inconsistencies/blob/main/formalize_121.py)
- the [output file](https://github.com/slawsk/tax-inconsistencies/blob/main/checkallunits.txt) with a result of running the program to use the formalization
- the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/slawsk/tax-inconsistencies/blob/main/requirements.txt) file for running the verification

This project is still very much in draft form.
