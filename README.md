# tax-inconsistencies

This repository includes files with the code and verifications discussed in Limiting Inconsistencies in Legal Languages. Specifically, here you can find:

- code with the formalization
- the output file with a result of running the program to verify the formalizations
- the requirements.txt file for running the verification

This project is still very much in draft form.
